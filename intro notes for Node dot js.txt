Process is a global variable that is central to Node

process.pid is the pid //what is pid? pid is process id

if you just type process you see all the stuff in process


Node never stops, sleeps, or waits to fetch and wait for things to come back

Node doesnt have the ability to sleep. only to use setTimeout
